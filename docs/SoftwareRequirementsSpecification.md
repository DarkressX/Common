# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes functional and non-functional requirements for the application "Common". It includes an overview about this project and its vision, detailed information about the planned features and boundary conditions of the development process. It also describes the correctness, uniqueness, and completeness of our project.

## 1.2 Scope
The project is going to be realized as a Web Application (Web-App).

Actors of the Website are the Users.

Planned Subsystems are:
  -	User interface:  
    The user interface is a website with chat room. 
  -	Account System:  
    To be able to use the Website you must create an account. After you create an account you are able to log in and log out. 
  -	Block a User:  
    During a Session a User can block and unblock another User. 
  -	Connecting People:  
    After two users chose the same topic in the web application, they get connected and start to chat together. Users can also quit a chat. 
  -	Storing Data:  
    The Data will be stored in a Database System. 
  - Topic:
    The user can write a topic of interest with an input option or choose a topic with proposal topics.

## 1.5 Overview
The following chapter provides an overview of this project with vision and Overall Use Case Diagram (UCD). The third chapter (Requirements Specification) delivers more details about the specific requirements in terms of functionality, usability, and design parameters. Finally, there is a chapter with supporting information.


# 2. Overall Description
## 2.1 Vision

The corona pandemic caused reduced personal contact with our fellow human beings. That is why we have set ourselves the goal of reuniting people in times of isolation. 

Common enables the exchange of “common” topics through a chatportal. This will be set up in a web application. The user chooses their preferred topic of conversation using an input option that allows them to define their topic of interest. Users with the same interests are matched by a random system and can exchange via a chat.

# 3. Specific Requirements
## 3.1 Functionality

This section will explain the different use cases, you could see in the Use Case Diagram, and their functionality

* 3.1.1 Create Account
* 3.1.2 Choose topic text
* 3.1.3 Chat
* 3.1.4 Quit chat/disconnect
* 3.1.5 Block another user

3.1.1 [Create Account](/docs/use_cases/CreateAccount.md)

This is the beginning for every interaction on our platform.
To initiate a chat the user has to create an account. Here he has to choose a username and enter an e-mail adress.
The username will be visible to the chat partner, once a successful match has been made.
These data will be saved in the database of common.

3.1.2 [Choose topic text](/docs/use_cases/ChooseUsernameAndTopic.md)

A topic of interest has to be entered. This will be used as a basis to make a match with another person. 
There is also the option to click on a suggested topic. These topics were entered by other user, who haven´t found a chatpartner yet. 

3.1.3 [Chat](/docs/use_cases/Chat.md)

This will be the main activity and will be automatically visible to the user, once a successful match has been made.
Here the user can chat with the matched partner.
Data in the chat is not saved in the database.

3.1.4 [Quit chat / disconnect](/docs/use_cases/QuitChatOrDisconnect.md)

To provide an option to leave the session, the user can click a button and the session will be terminated.
Once the session has been terminated, the users will both respectively be dropped back to the "Choose topic" window described in 3.1.2.
After leaving a chat, the data will be lose. 

3.1.5 [Block user](/docs/use_cases/BlockAnotherUser.md)

If one of the opposing partners is going against our user guidelines, the user has the option to report the user.
Should this happen, the IP address of the opposing partner and the IP address of the user will be logged, and ensured that a match between those partners can no longer happen.
The session will be terminated.

The Administrator has also the option to delete an account.

## 3.2 Usability

Due to the simplicity and design decisions made, our Web Service will be practically self-explanatory.

3.2.1 User friendliness

The Ui has a very simple design. The thought is that the user feels a sense of familiarity with other known webservices.
This will spare the user the hassle of trying to find simple functions since it will be intuitive.

## 3.3 Reliability

3.3.1 Availability

Load balancing and redundancy can be achieved using services like traefik, although this is not mandatory for this project.

## 3.4 Performance

3.4.1 Capacity

The System should be able to manage thousands of requests. Perhaps even more, if we can achieve to optimise the database connection.

3.4.2 Storage

Storage requirements are very small since no data will be kept long term except for reported IP addresses.

## 3.5 Supportability

3.5.1 Coding standards

We will be using modern coding standards. This will ensure that the team and future developers have an easier time understanding the code and providing future functionality.

3.5.2 Testing

Unit tests will be written to ensure system stability.

## 3.6 Design constraints

Back-End and Front-End will be kept separately. The Back-End will provide a RESTful API which the Front-End can use to communicate with the Back-End.
The Back-End will provide data using the JSON format. The RESTful API will not be exposed to the public internet, but will rather be kept in an internal network. This will provide an additional security layer against attackers.

## 3.7 On-line User Documentation and Help System Requirements

The usage of the app should be as intuitive as possible so it won't need any further documentation. If the user needs some help we will implement a "Help"-Button in the App which includes a FAQ and a formular to contact the developement team.

## 3.8 Interfaces

3.8.1 User Interfaces

The User interfaces we will implement:
* Dashboard - Adds the posibility to create an account or log in.
* Create Account - Adds the possibility to create an account..
* Choose Topic - Adds the posibility to choose a topic the user wants to talk about.
* Chat Page - Shows information about the session and a chat window.
* Settings - Shows the settings.

3.8.2 Software Interfaces

The application will be available as a website with primary focus on desktop users.

3.8.3 Communication Interfaces

The users can communicate with the webpage using the http/https protocol.

## 3.9 Licensing Requirements

tbd

## 3.10 Legal, Copyright, and Other Notices

The logo is licensed to the Common Team and is only allowed to use for the application. We do not take responsibility for any incorrect data or errors in the application.

## 3.11 Applicable Standards

The development will follow the common clean code standards and naming conventions.
