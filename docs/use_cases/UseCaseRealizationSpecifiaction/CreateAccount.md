First the Client will connect to our Website. Here the front end will present the user the choice to create an account.
A user account is mandatory to use the site. Should the user choose to create an account, he will be asked to enter a username and password.
After he entered his data and clicked "create", the frontend will make a HTTP POST request to the backend with the entered data in JSON format.
The backend will then enter the data into a database for persistent storage.

## 3. Derived Requirements

Should we plan to require an email address during the account creation, there has to be some kind of validation for this.
Possible methods are sending a confirmation email with a link which the user has to click.
